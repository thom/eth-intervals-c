Build instructions:

$ git clone git://github.com/thom/eth-intervals-c.git
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../
$ make
$ make doc
$ make install

Intervals uses C blocks (http://thirdcog.eu/pwcblocks/) and therefore
clang to compile. The CMake file can build and install the needed
compiler and libraries:

$ make compiler-rt llvm

This fetches, builds and installs compiler-rt and LLVM including
clang.

By default, compiler-rt and LLVM are fetched to and built in

  ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/local

You can configure this by specifying the CMake option

  -D LOCAL_DIR=/path/to/local/dir

LLVM and compiler-rt will be installed into

  ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/local

Use the CMake option

  -D LLVM_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/llvm/installation/dir

to change the LLVM installation prefix.


Note: 

You also have to set LLVM_INSTALL_PREFIX if you installed LLVM and
clang on your own in another directory as the CMake scripts will use
LLVM_INSTALL_PREFIX to determine the location of clang and the Blocks
runtime.

Clean your build directory after building LLVM and compiler-rt and run
cmake again:

# in build/
$ rm -rf *
$ cmake ../
$ make
